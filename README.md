# Angular Firebase Template

This is a base project for Angular integrating Firebase e-mail authentication. It's designed to start your project without the need of mess with authentication.

It also integrates [PrimeNG UI components](https://www.primefaces.org/primeng/#/) to build the user interface.

## Setting up

Just clone the repo and run:

`npm install`

or

`yarn install`

## Running the project

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
